                Here's some information about me:
            </p>
            <p>I'm a computer engineering major</p>
            <p>I've taken classes like CS01, CS10, and CS50 but am really looking forward to classes like ENGS028 and ENGS031</p>
            <p>Classes that are more hardware based are really exciting and I'm looking forward to getting into the nitty gritty of it.</p>
            <p>Fun fact about myself: I can deadlift almost 3 times my bodyweight. I weigh around 123lbs and can deadlift 330lbs</p>
